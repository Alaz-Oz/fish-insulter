# fish-insulter

The Fish-Insulter is a fun utility that randomly teases or jests at the user when an incorrect command is typed. It is inspired from the [bash-insulter](https://github.com/hkbakke/bash-insulter) project to add a playful twist to Fish Shell!

**Disclaimer: No users were harmed during the making of this utility. ðŸ˜„**

### Customization
The Fish-Insulter allows for easy customization using environment variables, offering control over the insults' content, frequency, and appearance. These variables can be set in your `config.fish` file or created in a file within the `conf.d` directory of your Fish configuration folder.

#### Available Environment Variables:

- **`CMD_NOT_FOUND_MSGS`**: Custom messages to replace the default insult list.

- **`CMD_NOT_FOUND_MSGS_APPEND`**: Additional messages to complement the existing insult list.

- **`COMMENT_FREQ`**: Sets the frequency of insults. A value of `0` means never, `5` implies about half the time, and `10` triggers an insult every time. (Default: `4`)

- **`COMMENT_COLOR`**: Specifies the text color printed with a number from 1 to 255. Using `0` results in a random color for added enjoyment. (Default: `0`)

#### Configuration Steps:

1. **For `config.fish`**:
   
   Open your `config.fish` file using a text editor and add or modify the desired environment variables in the following format:
   ```fish
   set -gx CMD_NOT_FOUND_MSGS "Your custom insult messages here"
   set -gx CMD_NOT_FOUND_MSGS_APPEND "Additional insults to append"
   set -gx COMMENT_FREQ 5
   set -gx COMMENT_COLOR 123
   ```

2. **For `conf.d` Directory**:
   
   Create a new file (e.g., `insulter-customization.fish`) within your Fish configuration's `conf.d` directory. Inside this file, define the environment variables in the same format as above.

Ensure to replace the values with your preferred messages, frequencies, or colors as desired.

## Future enhancements 
- **Angel Mode**: A kinder, supportive alternative.
- Improved customization options for a tailored experience.
